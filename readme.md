# AI Coupon Recognizer
WIP. Written in C# using .NET Maui

An Android app that uses AI to make the shopping process easier and more affordable by facilitating couponing!

It's designed to take images of coupon pages from a user, match them to a barcode, then take images of purchasable items and see if the purchasable items are found in the images of the coupons. It will then display a collection of the appropriate barcodes based on which items the user is purchasing

Will only work with coupons that have images of the products, as a database with product images and names is not easily/freely available currently. Though if it were this could be easily adapted to work with those as well
